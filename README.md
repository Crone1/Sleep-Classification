The project consists of three notebooks:

1. Introduction and Data Preperation (1-intro-and-data-preperation.ipynb)

2. Feature Extraction (2-feature-extraction.ipynb)

3. Classification and Results (3-classification-and-results.ipynb)

There are two stages in our notebooks which take a lot of time
- the turning all of the rows and second intervals into a uniform 1 secod interval in the data preperation notebook
- and the feature extraction in the feature extraction.notebook

These cells are marked accordingly. 

The notebooks runs perfectly otherwise and these long running cells can be skipped as we have output the resulting data to a json file at the end of each notebook so running one cell will not hold the other notebooks.
